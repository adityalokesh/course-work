# CSE-511  
Greetings! I am **Aditya**, a second-year Master’s student at **Arizona State University** pursuing a Master’s in **Data Science**. I am deeply passionate about **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Data Science**. Below is a detailed overview of my coursework, projects, and assignments.

## Year 1  

### CSE-569 – Statistical Machine Learning (Instructor: Boxin Li)  
This course was both challenging and intellectually stimulating. I gained a strong understanding of Bayesian mathematics, d-separation, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), kernel density estimation, and decision boundaries for Bayesian classifiers. Additionally, I learned both parametric and non-parametric density estimation methods.  

**Projects:**  

#### Project 1 – PCA, Density Estimation, and Bayesian Classification  
[project-1.pdf](./project-1.pdf)  
- Downloaded, cleaned, and transformed the dataset (including normalization).  
- Applied **PCA**, identifying ~200 eigenvectors; 8 were significant.  
- Selected **2 principal components** capturing the most variance for dimensionality reduction.  
- Visualized the data in the principal vector space.  
- Implemented **Bayesian estimation** in 2D space and applied **minimum-error-rate classification**.  

#### Project 2 – Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Implementation  
[project-2.pdf](./project-2.pdf)  
- Collected, cleaned, and preprocessed the dataset.  
- Designed and built the **CNN model layer by layer**.  
- Trained and tested the model; reported **accuracy metrics** and analysis.

### CSE-543 – Information Assurance and Security (Instructor: Stefan Yua)  
This course provided a comprehensive overview of **data protection**, **privacy**, and **security**, covering various levels of protection and how different modules address specific aspects of securing data.  

**Projects & Assignments:**  
- **Weekly Reports** ([Weekly_Reports.zip](./Weekly_Reports.zip)) – Compiled a literature survey of weekly readings, summarizing key insights from academic papers.

### CSE-598 – Special Topics: Data-Driven Optimization  
This mathematics-focused course emphasized **optimization techniques** for real-world problems.  
- Gained hands-on experience using solvers like **CPLEX**, **HIGS**, and **GLPK**.  
- Modeled and solved complex optimization problems efficiently.
