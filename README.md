# CSE-511
Greetings,I am aditya a 2nd year masters student at ASU (Masters in Data Science), I am passionate about ML,AI and Data science. My current courses the projects ,assignments done towards the courses in detail.

# Year 1

# CSE-569 - Statistical Machine learning (Boxin li)
The course was challenging and interesting to do,I learned bayesian math , d-seperation and PCA , kernel estmate. The non parametric and parametrics density estimate methods , decision boundries for bayesian etc.


The course has 2 main projects: 
# 1 PCA ,Density and bayesian Estimation(./project-1.pdf)
The project was fairly straighforward ,I downloaded the data cleaned and transfomed the data ie normalization etc for the data.
Then PCA analysis I identified about 200 eigen vectors but the significant was only 8. These vectors were then plotted to analyze of which I found only 2 principal vectors based on eigen vector analysis.

The vectors were then use to reduce the size of the data and I plotted them on the vectors space. 

Then we prepare a bayseian estimate in 2d space  then identified the space using minimum-error-rate classification for the data.


# Project part 2 (./project-2.pdf)
This project was straightfoward deep learning CNN with sepecification of the models. The data was retreived cleaned and prepared the data.
The model was built as per specification and the each individual layer then trained tested and accuracy and the results are reported.

# CSE-543 - Information Assurance and security(Stefen yua)
This course was informative on data protection and privacy protection for data, levels of protection different modules deal with different layers of protection. The projects 

# weekly reports (./Weekly_Reports.zip)
The paper survey for the weekly reports and list of all additional papers for the litreature survey.


# CSE 598 - SpecialTopics
Data -drive optimization 
This math course included work on solvers and minization solvers and real -world modelling of problems and solving them using CPLEX, HIGS,GLPK.
